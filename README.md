## CPGraphSort

CPGraphSort is a tool designed to convert and autogenerate graphs and sorted data for the results of the SpotAssayQuant Pipeline found [here](https://github.com/sah129/Spot-Assay-Quant). The program takes multiple .csv files uploaded by the user, sorts the data and generates .csv files,graphs, and tables, all available as a zip file for download.

This tool will be hosted shortly on the [O'Donnell Lab](https://www.odonnelllab.com/) website for accessible use.  In addition a number of other automation scripts will be hosted there as well for ease-of-access.

This is still a work in progress so if you need your results quantified immediately please do not hesitate to email me at sah129@pitt.edu and I will run the script for you.
